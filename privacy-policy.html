        <p><strong>Registered Address:</strong> saket, new delhi</p>
        <p>

        <h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>
            If you have questions, requests, or concerns about this Privacy
            Policy, please contact us at:

        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect multiple types of information to operate effectively and
          provide you the best experience. The categories of information we
          collect include:
        </p>

        <h3>1.1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <p>
          When you register, create an account, fill forms, contact us, or
          otherwise communicate with us, you may provide personal information
          such as your name, email address, phone number, billing and payment
          information, profile information, and other identifiers. For
          businesses, this may include the business contact person, company
          name, and business address â€” only when you entered that information
          and only if entity_type is 'business'. For individual operators,
          business name and address are intentionally omitted from this Policy
          output and will not appear in rendered policy text.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
          We automatically collect technical and usage data when you interact
          with the Platform, which may include IP address, device identifiers,
          device model and operating system, browser type, language preferences,
          access times, pages visited, search queries, referring/exit pages,
          crash logs, and performance metrics.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3. Location Data</h3>
        <p>
          We may collect approximate or precise location data from your device
          if you grant location permissions. Location data may be used to
          provide location-sensitive functionality, improve service relevance,
          or for fraud prevention. You can control location access in your
          device settings.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4. Payment and Transaction Data</h3>
        <p>
          When you make purchases or use paid features, we collect payment data
          (such as billing name, billing address, and payment card details)
          which is processed by secure third-party payment processors. We do not
          store full payment card numbers on our servers unless explicitly
          required and disclosed.
        </p>

        <h3>1.5. Communications and Support Data</h3>
        <p>
          We maintain records of communications and support interactions to
          provide assistance, detect abuse, and improve service quality. These
          records may include email content, chat transcripts, telephone logs,
          and attachments you send.
        </p>

        <h3>1.6. Derived and Aggregated Data</h3>
        <p>
          We may derive non-identifying, aggregated, or de-identified data from
          the information we collect. Aggregated data is used for analytics,
          performance measurement, and research; it cannot reasonably be used to
          identify you.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

            services.

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons,
          pixels, and local storage) to enhance user experience, analyze site
          and app performance, remember your preferences, and deliver relevant
          content. You can manage cookie preferences via your device or browser
          settings and opt out of certain types of cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We classify cookies into categories including essential cookies,
          preference cookies, analytics cookies, and advertising cookies.
          Essential cookies enable core functionality. Preference and analytics
          cookies support personalization and performance. Advertising cookies
          enable targeted ads (only used if we operate ads or use ad networks).

        <p>
          Our platform may display advertisements and use advertising networks
          to serve those ads. Advertisers or ad networks may use cookies or
          other tracking technologies to collect information about users'
          activities across services to provide targeted advertising. If we use
          Google AdSense or other contextual ad providers, you may review their
          privacy documents for additional controls. We utilize analytics tools
          to collect aggregated and anonymized usage statistics to improve the
          Platform. These tools may collect information such as pages visited,
          time spent, device information, and general geographic data. Analytics
          data is used internally for product improvements and troubleshooting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where third-party advertising or analytics vendors operate, their own
          privacy policies govern their data practices. We recommend reviewing
          such policies for more details and opt-out tools.

        </ul>
        <p>
          We may share data with the following categories of third parties:
          Google Ads and Other. These service providers assist with hosting,
          payment processing, customer support, analytics, communication, and
          other necessary operations.
        </p>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          We generally store and process data within our operating jurisdiction.
          If we do transfer data internationally, we will ensure appropriate
          protections are in place.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide
          services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce
          agreements, and for legitimate business purposes. Retention periods
          vary by data type and legal requirements. Where possible, we will
          honor deletion requests, subject to verification and legal exceptions.
          You may request deletion of personal data we hold about you. We will
          process deletion requests in accordance with applicable law and our
          internal retention policies. Deletion may be subject to verification
          steps and exceptions where retention is required for legal or
          legitimate business purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          We use administrative, technical, and physical controls designed to
          protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
          alteration, and destruction. Controls include access controls,
          encryption in transit and at rest (where applicable), secure data
          centers, vulnerability scanning, and internal security policies. While
          we strive to use reasonable safeguards, no system can be guaranteed to
          be 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our Platform is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the
          minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect
          personal information from children without parental consent. If a
          parent or guardian believes we have collected information from a child
          under the applicable age without consent, please contact us and we
          will take steps to delete such data.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you reside, you may have rights including the right
          to access, correct, or delete your personal data, the right to
          portability, the right to restrict or object to processing, and the
          right to withdraw consent. You may also have the right to opt-out of
          certain data uses or profiling, and to opt-out of the sale or sharing
          of personal information where applicable. To exercise these rights,
          contact us at the email address listed above. We will verify requests
          consistent with applicable law and respond within applicable
          timeframes.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Rights for European Residents (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>
          Where applicable law provides additional rights (for example, under
          regional or local privacy laws), we will comply with those rights.
          This policy aims to respect globally recognized privacy principles.
          Under GDPR, you may request access to your personal data,
          rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability,
          and to object to processing. In some cases, you can lodge a complaint
          with a supervisory authority where you believe your rights have been
          violated.

          If you are a California resident, you may have rights under the
          California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights
          Act (CPRA). This policy contains sections describing how to exercise
          those rights, including access, deletion, and opt-out of sale/sharing
          (if applicable). If you are a California resident, you can request
          details about the categories of personal data we collect, the
          categories of sources, the categories of recipients, and the business
          purposes for collection. You may request deletion and opt-out of sale
          or sharing where applicable. We do not knowingly sell the personal
          information of minors under 16 without affirmative authorization.

          with applicable safeguards and legal mechanisms for cross-border data
          flows.
        </p>

        <h2>19. Retention, Anonymization and Archiving</h2>
        <p>
          When data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was
          collected, we delete or anonymize it. In some cases we may retain
          information for historical, statistical, or legal compliance reasons.
          Anonymized or aggregated data may be retained indefinitely and used
          for analytics and research.

          required by law.

        <h2>24. Miscellaneous</h2>
