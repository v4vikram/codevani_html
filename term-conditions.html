          USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,

          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
          privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
          inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party

          fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
          limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
          means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
          states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
          permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all
          faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent
          permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
          behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and
          service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether
          express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,
          including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
          particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that
          may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
          trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company
          provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of
          any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any
          intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
          applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet
          any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any
          errors or defects can or will be corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
          company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
          express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
          Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
          included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
          error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any
          information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the
          Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf

          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law.
        </p>

        <h3>Severability</h3>
        <p>

          affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
          performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
          constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
        </p>
